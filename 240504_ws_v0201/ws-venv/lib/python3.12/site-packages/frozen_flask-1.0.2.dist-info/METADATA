Frozen-Flask
============

Freezes a Flask application into a set of static files. The result can be hosted
without any server-side software other than a traditional web server.

See documentation: https://frozen-flask.readthedocs.io/

Contributing
------------

* Fork the upstream repository and clone your fork
* Create a feature branch for the thing you want to work on
* Create a virtual environment and activate it
* Run ``pip install -e .[doc,test,check]`` to install dependencies
* Add your changes
* Make sure tests pass with ``pytest``
* Make sure you followed the style guide with ``flake8`` and ``isort``
* Send a pull request to the upstream repository

You can also use `Hatch <https://hatch.pypa.io/>`_ to automatically install
dependencies, launch tests, check style and build documentation::

  $ hatch run test:run
  $ hatch run check:run
  $ hatch run doc:build
