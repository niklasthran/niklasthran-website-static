An experimental tool to produce video glitches that pursues the idea of using video data as a material that can be mixed, transformed and scrambled around like it was physical matter.

Originated from experiments in the context of [Fabiola Hannah](http://fabiolahanna.com/)'s (Un)Coding Video class at The New School.
