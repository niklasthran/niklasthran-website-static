*Cymatic Types* is an interactive audiovisual installation, based on experiments by Ernst Chladni. Following the concept of a visual language, it interprets images of standing waves as specific signs. Those images occur on oscillating surfaces through a granular material that is being formed into patterns at certain frequencies. By digitizing the structures and reducing their complexity, the emerging types can be accessed and observed during their reforming.
