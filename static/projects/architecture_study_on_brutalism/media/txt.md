title: Architecture Study on Brutalism

This study explores Brutalism by putting a focus on the appearance of the material and shapes that are significant to the architectural style. The images show experiments that reassemble parts taken from unrelated buildings and transform them into barely possible sculptures. The newly emerged structures exhibit a visible uniformity and bold geometrics that embody the aura of this genre.
