*Tabula Rasa* is a data-driven video installation. Inspired by the philosophical concept of the clean slate, it explores the technology of Deep Reinforcement Learning in machine learning. An agent’s training is visually interpreted through abstract-organic aesthetics as it is simulated in a fluid environment. As the agent’s single goal is to move forward, all motion data has been generated in its unsupervised learning process.

A collaboration with [Robin Woern](https://robinwoern.com/), [Zihern Lee](https://linktr.ee/zihern) and [Adrian Pfisterer](https://github.com/adripfi)
